I had been on Cullaby Lake many years ago (~1985) with an aquatic plant expert from the OR Dept of Ag who wanted to get a name for a prominent plant in the lake (Brassenia).  I also remember seeing Cabomba.  Both plants are still in the lake.  We put out the mussel web, didn't find any anoxia near the deepest part of the lake; slight decrease in temp to bottom.  We did find many bryozoans in the aquatic plant beds near shore.  This is probably Pectinatella magnifica.  The density and biomass of the individuals we saw in these nearshore plant beds suggest a huge total biomass.  Understanding the role of these bryozoans in this lake is of interest.  The water in Cullaby is very well colored (dark rusty brown).  There is a large relatively flat watershed to the south that may be contributing much of the decomposed plant materials to the lake.

Zooplankton were sampled at this station using a 30 cm diameter net opening with a 64 micrometer mesh.  A sample of phytoplankton was obtained from 0.5 m. into a 500 ml container and preserved with 1% Lugol's solution.

Set set the minnow trap in shallow ater near the eastern shore and baited it with cat food.  No crayfish caught by end of sampling.

Collected snails on Nuphar leaves but found no snails near shore by boat ramp.

We attached the mussel webbing to the slow-no wake buoy at northern end of lake.    "

Mine was the only boat on the lake. Beautiful clear blue sky, and the mosquitoes were hungry. I left my DNA all around the shoreline. If I come back I will be swatting at relatives.

Rough-skinned newts were common throughout the lake. I saw no fish or signs of fish activity.

A small dam has been constructed at the outlet creek on the south end of the lake, raising the normal lake water levels 8-10"" and drowning some of the shoreline vegetation. There is also evidence of shoreline erosion occurring from the higher water levels; most evident along the eastern shoreline.

After a survey of the edges of the lake with a plant sampler (thrown double sided rake), we set up a cluster sampling device at the canoe launch location.  This cluster is comprised of a 3-4 ft length of 1.5 inch d PVC to which is attached a submersed microscope slide holder, a length of webbing submerged at PVC.  Measurement was made from top of PVC to water surface to track water level changes in next few months.

Samples were obtained at Station 1 (deepest water station) with 0.3 m diameter net opening zooplankton net (64 micrometer mesh) top to bottom vertical pull, and a surface grab sample 500 ml for phytoplankton.

A plunger (shaped like a large plastic crayon) was used to sample phytoplankton, zooplankton and sediment in the vicinity of the nearshore PVC cluster (5 pulls for zooplankton), tip bottle and fill for phytoplankton and suck sediment with the plunger at 3-4 separate locations near the PVC cluster.
