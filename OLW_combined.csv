I had been on Cullaby Lake many years ago (~1985) with an aquatic plant expert from the OR Dept of Ag who wanted to get a name for a prominent plant in the lake (Brassenia).  I also remember seeing Cabomba.  Both plants are still in the lake.  We put out the mussel web, didn't find any anoxia near the deepest part of the lake; slight decrease in temp to bottom.  We did find many bryozoans in the aquatic plant beds near shore.  This is probably Pectinatella magnifica.  The density and biomass of the individuals we saw in these nearshore plant beds suggest a huge total biomass.  Understanding the role of these bryozoans in this lake is of interest.  The water in Cullaby is very well colored (dark rusty brown).  There is a large relatively flat watershed to the south that may be contributing much of the decomposed plant materials to the lake.

Zooplankton were sampled at this station using a 30 cm diameter net opening with a 64 micrometer mesh.  A sample of phytoplankton was obtained from 0.5 m. into a 500 ml container and preserved with 1% Lugol's solution.

A plunger (shaped like a large plastic crayon) was used to sample phytoplankton, zooplankton and sediment in the vicinity of the nearshore PVC cluster (5 pulls for zooplankton), tip bottle and fill for phytoplankton and suck sediment with the plunger at 3-4 separate locations near the PVC cluster.
